# edge-detection-OpenCV-projects
multimedia systems third project spring 2024 Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV, including shape detection, color channel analysis, histogram equalization, smoothing, and edge detection. The exercises explore key OpenCV functions for analyzing and modifying images for real-world applications, such as area-based water distribution and edge detection.

Project Overview
The project comprises four main exercises:

Shape Detection: Identify different shapes in an image and label them. Remove non-quadrilateral shapes from the image.
Water Allocation by Area: Calculate water allocation based on the area of farmland in an image, then rank and label each plot by water share.
Color Channel and Histogram Analysis: Separate and visualize RGB color channels, compute histograms, and apply histogram equalization for contrast enhancement.
Smoothing and Edge Detection: Apply various smoothing filters and edge detection algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness.

Analysis
Filter Comparison: The project explores the effect of Gaussian, Median, and Sharpening filters on edge thickness, edge detection accuracy, and detail preservation.
Edge Detection: Sobel and Canny algorithms are compared based on edge clarity and detection of both horizontal and vertical lines.
